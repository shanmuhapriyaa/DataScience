# My journey in Data Science

 * 30 days back I was a noob in data science. I was trained in pandas,numpy, plotting and various classification and regression methods.
 * All these helped me to understand the 2% of data science. I took interest into this and was able to develop a full end to
 end analysis and create a simple application. Now I would like to learn more and starting my leanring journey to become a pro
 by mastering this subject.
 
 * My motivation to write was so that this pushes me to learn and develop myself & other noobs who are looking to start their career
 journey in machine learning.
 
 * Each week what I do will be updated in the weekly list. A plan list will also be present. This plan will work in a way that one is able to spend
 1 hour per day and 4 hours during weekends. The plan can be customized as per your convenience.
 
 Happy Learning! Wishing everyone a successful start!
